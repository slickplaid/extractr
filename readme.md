fun experiment with 7z and electron

working to get a gui and watcher for extracting downloaded rars and cleaning up
after it's done

hoping to do CRC checks on SFV files, but I haven't been able to get native
SSE4_CRC32 processor instruction set to work yet

right now everything is hard coded for my setup and is not workable
